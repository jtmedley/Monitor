
1. Object of class ConfigVentForManual always creates struct termios options
2. Stream must already be open for structure to be modified
	Code works by importing default attributes from open stream to structure, then setting structure to desired attributes, then plugging structure back into stream - only modified attributes are visible
3. Class details public functions that set values in structure
4. Default class constructor == servo-i, uses settings from previous HelloWorldForMBED
5. Pass a vent name to constructor to apply settings - probably requires input from user if not default
